This demo video showcases the **SlotMachineAnimator** project, a custom slot machine view built with UIKit, Combine, and SnapKit.  
The animation replicates the feel of a real slot machine, smoothly rolling items until the final result is centered.

### Key Highlights
- Smooth **spinning animation** using `CADisplayLink`
- Dynamic **cell resizing** for the center item
- Automatic **snap-to-center** behavior after scrolling
- Reusable and flexible **UICollectionView + custom flow layout**
- The final stopping item is **randomized** each time

The video demonstrates how the slot machine spins, slows down, and precisely stops on a random target item â€” creating a polished and realistic slot machine effect.

### SPM
